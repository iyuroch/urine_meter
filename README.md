Idea of measuring flow rate from weight of urine

### Statement of the problem
In cardiac postoperative period there are multiple problems with patients we need to address with accurate continuous measurments:
1. Vascular pressure (both venous and arterial)
2. ECG
3. Blood oxygenation
4. Urination
5. Patient wieght
Occasionally we need to evaluate with more specific instrumental methods: echocardiography etc.
</br>
These methods indirectly tries to measure effectiveness and function of cardiovascular system.
To ensure that heart can manage all periferal vascular resistance we can look for balance between fluid intake and extraction.
If we have low extraction and high intake this can lead us to assumption that we need to search for a problem with specific patients.
Although these are not very specific indicators, due to the fact that extraction depends not only on blood pressure but also on 
the state of renal system, which can be affected by different types of medicine (diuretics, neuromediators, ACE inhibitors etc.)
Fluid intake is solved in postoperative with accurate management of intravenous fluid therapy, but extraction is done with either 
uroflowmetry or per-hour weight or/and volume measurement with help of urine drainage bags.
</br>
### Proposal
To solve this problem we propose coninuous weighting of urine drainage bags with specialized device. Datagrams can further be used
to find correlations between flood intake and extraction to indicate problems early. Also having data on medication used we can see 
effects of medication to further estimate effectiveness or need. </br>
This does not limit potential field of such device - it also can be used to find common patterns of urination in different type of
 renal and heart system desease.
